# Don't Fall

## Overview
Don't Fall is a game that challenges players to control the character using the powerful recoil of their shotgun.  
The main objective is to navigate through the game environment, avoiding randomly spawned obstacles.  
The twist lies in strategically collecting ammo to maintain airborne momentum and prevent the inevitable descent, that results in losing the game.
